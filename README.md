# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. Though it's not secure for modern use, it is widely used in introductory cryptography lessons.

We implement the Caesar Cipher to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages. The user can input a message and a shift value (between 0 and 25), and the program will either encrypt or decrypt the message based on their choice.

**Encryption**:  
   The process of converting plaintext (readable message) into ciphertext (encoded message) using a specific algorithm and key (shift value).
   
**Decryption**:  
   The process of converting the ciphertext (encoded message) back into its original form (plaintext) using the same key (shift value).

## Example Usage

### Encrypt
- **Message**: `Cybersecurity`
- **Shift**: `3`
- **Encrypted Message**: `Fbhhuvhfxulwb`

### Decrypt
- **Message**: `Fbhhuvhfxulwb`
- **Shift**: `3`
- **Decrypted Message**: `Cybersecurity`
